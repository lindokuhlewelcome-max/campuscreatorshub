Campus Creators Hub — Website Package
====================================

Files:
- index.html (Home)
- services.html (Services & Projects)
- about.html (About & Contact)
- style.css (styles)
- script.js (small interactivity)
- images/ (logo.jpg and poster.jpg placeholders)

How to deploy on GitHub Pages (quick):
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., campus-creators-hub).
2. Upload the contents of this ZIP to the repository root.
3. In GitHub, go to Settings > Pages, and set the source to the 'main' branch root (or use the branch where you've uploaded files).
4. Save — your site will be published at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/ (may take a minute).

Tips:
- Replace placeholder images in images/ with real portfolio items.
- To add a video, embed a YouTube link in the About page where indicated.
- If you want a contact form, GitHub Pages are static; use Formspree or Netlify Forms for form handling.
